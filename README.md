Start Processing. Experiment with some of the examples shown in class and read tutorials.

<ol start="2">

 <li>Design and create your own sketch using Processing. Think of yourself as a creative designer when choosing the topic of your design. This is your very first sketch, so here are some guidelines:

  <ul>

   <li>Make sure that it is at least 500 pixels by 500 pixels.</li>

   <li>Make use of any of the drawing primitives learned in class in the past week:</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>

size, no/smooth, stroke, fill, point, line, rect, triangle, ellipse, quad, begin/endShape, arc, curve, etc.

<ul>

 <li>Your sketch should make use of at least five basic shape functions (as this is the point of this assignment!). A really “abstract” sketch like a simple circle in the center of the screen will not suffice (as asthetic as it may seem).</li>

 <li>Make sure to have your signature on your drawing. Design your own signature by using text() function.</li>

</ul>

To give you some ideas, several sketches will be presented in class. Here are some additional ideas:

<ul>

 <li>A self-portrait</li>

 <li>An avatar or a cartoon of someone</li>

 <li>Your favorite cartoon TV Show character (e.e. South Park), or design your own…</li>

 <li>A city scape</li>

 <li>Animal/object caricatures/study</li>

 <li>A Post Card Design</li>

 <li>A fabric pattern</li>

 <li>Stylize your name’s initials…or a log-</li>

</ul>
